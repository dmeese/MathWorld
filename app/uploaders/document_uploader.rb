  # include CarrierWave::MiniMagick

  # Include the Sprockets helpers for Rails 3.1+ asset pipeline compatibility:

  # if the environment variable is set, then use AWS

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  # def default_url

  #
  #   "/images/fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_')
  # end

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  # process :scale => [200, 300]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)
  #   # do something
  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :thumb do
    process :resize_to_limit => [50, 50]


   # Will ned to add something like  for PDF support
   #pdf = Magick::ImageList.new("doc.pdf")
   #thumb = pdf.scale(300, 300)
   #thumb.write "doc.png"

   # Maybe support office in the future with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3327441/how-to-convert-ppt-to-images-in-ruby

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  # def extension_white_list
  #   %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  # end

    %w(txt pdf jpg jpeg gif png)

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # def filename
