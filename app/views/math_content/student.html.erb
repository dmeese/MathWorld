	<!-- Document is the Model class (derived from ActiveRecord::Base) which connects to our documents table
	     in the database.  where is a standard method of ActiveRecord which gets translated to a properly
	     formatted where clause in the database.  In this case the where clause is empty (there may be a better
	     method to use in this case).
	     The return value is a collection of Document objects (actually an array).  Calling the each method
	     on the collection allow iterating in a loop; the loop is defined by do..end, and the loop variable (the
	     iterated variable from the collection) is denoted by enclosing between pipes (|)
